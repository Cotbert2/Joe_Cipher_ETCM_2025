Python Proof of Concept implementation for JoeCipher Chaos-Driven Algorithm
This github repository contains a Python implementation of the JoeCipher Chaos-Driven Algorithm, a symmetric key block cipher that utilizes chaotic Lorenz Attractor for encryption and decryption processes.
The repository is part of supplementary materials for the paper "Chaos-Driven Encryption: A Lorenz and ElGamal Hybrid Model for Secure Communication" published in ETCM-2025.

## Features
- Encryption and decryption of plaintext using a symmetric key.
- Utilizes chaotic Lorenz Attractor for enhanced security.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cotbert2/Joe_Cipher_ETCM_2025.git
cd Joe_Cipher_ETCM_2025
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script you want:

```bash
python3 example.py
```

## Test
This repository includes a folder with some test scripts to validate the implementation.
